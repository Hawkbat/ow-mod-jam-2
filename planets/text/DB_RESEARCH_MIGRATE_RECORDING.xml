		<Text>PILEA: I've been learning a lot about the insectoid creatures here since we build this observation post. I'm calling them "hoppers" since they, well, hop around.</Text>

		<Text>PILEA: I'll log any additional findings here as I discover them. Learning the xenobiology of this place is the best way I can help.</Text>
